Hello!
This is not another telegram bot
(if you still think it is, you're being absolutely delusional and should probably see a doctor on that...)

Here are the available commands:

/help       - view this message
/timer      - set a timer for n minutes
/play       - play a guessing game with a bot
/cancel     - cancel setting a timer / playing a game
/define     - find definition for a request in english in wikipedia

you can also just try to say hi (in russian, too!)
